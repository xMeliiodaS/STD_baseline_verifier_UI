# AT Baseline Verifier – WPF UI (C#)

The **frontend application** for the AT Baseline Verifier project.  
Built with **WPF (C#)**, it delivers an interactive and modern interface inspired by *Solo Leveling’s Daily Quest UI*.  
It connects with the Python backend to present validation results in a user-friendly format.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Provide a desktop UI for test baseline verification.  
- Handle user input (datasets, config options, test IDs).  
- Trigger Python backend scripts seamlessly.  
- Display results, logs, and reports with a clean visual experience.  

---

## 🖥️ Features
- Custom **Solo Leveling–inspired UI** (non-standard window design).  
- Input forms for selecting data files / test cases.  
- Direct integration with Python scripts.  
- Visual display of logs and results.  
- Easy navigation with a polished WPF layout.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User interacts with the WPF interface.  
2. The app prepares the parameters and calls the Python backend.  
3. Python processes the data and generates outputs (logs + reports).  
4. WPF displays the results in the UI.
